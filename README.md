# GitHub Repository Stats Generator

## About the Project

The GitHub Repository Stats Generator is a web service that dynamically generates an image showcasing statistics about a GitHub repository's contributors. The image includes the top contributors, their avatars, and the number of contributions they have made to the repository.

This project is designed to be integrated into other repositories, allowing users to easily display their repository's contributor statistics using a simple HTML image tag.
